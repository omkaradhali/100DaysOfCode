# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 15, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Started with template strings (ES6) and new string functions (.startsWith(), .endsWith(), .repeat(), .inlcude())

**Thoughts:** Need to practice more examples for template strings and other implementations. Also need to practice implementing reduce() method more often.

### Day 2: Jan 16, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Worked explicitly on reduce method. Looked at some exaples and even tried few things. https://repl.it/@omkaradhali/ES6ReduceMethod

**Thoughts:** Reduce method is extremly useful when we want to map and filter a huge data. Need to practice enabling piping and using reduce method with promises
